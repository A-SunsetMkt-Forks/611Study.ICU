`611Study.ICU` refers to the "Study from 6 AM to 11 PM, end up in ICU" lifestyle, which is the forced schedule in many junior and senior high schools in China. Countless students suffer both physically and mentally from this schedule.
Through this project, we aim to help Chinese students escape this prison-like timetable and have a healthy and happy childhood.

This project is inspired by [996.ICU](https://996.icu/#/zh_CN), a cry from programmers about the 996 working system.

What is the 611Study system?
---

The "611" system refers to a school schedule that is commonly enforced in junior and senior high schools in China (from 6 AM to school, until 11 PM when school ends, sometimes with 6 or 7 working days a week). This schedule means that students are required to study for at least 102 hours a week.
